Refactor Plan for looks_gems Project

1. Remove unnecessary/unreferenced files:
   - /admin/jquery.html (not used)
   - /assets/Unconfirmed *.crdownload (incomplete downloads)
   - /assets/.DS_Store (system file)
   - /assets/images/ (empty)

2. Review all PHP files for duplicate or unused code blocks, especially in /admin and /includes.

3. Ensure only required images are kept in /assets and /uploads.

4. Keep only theme.css in /css, remove unused CSS files if any.

5. Remove empty /js folder.

6. Add comments and modularize code in all PHP files, especially for authentication, product/category management, cart, wishlist, and admin panel.

7. Validate that all features and UI remain unchanged after cleanup.

8. Document any changes in this file.
